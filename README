Databuf is a small C library for data serialization.

Using databuf it is possible to serialize data using the databuf_write*
functions. The library takes care of the byte order.

When we have finished writing we can get a pointer to the serialized
data and use it for our purposes.

In addition to writing, we can set up a data buffer and read it using
the databuf_read* functions.
